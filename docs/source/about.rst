About
======================================

What's this about?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OutSourcer is a self-hosted, minimalist REST API which aims to ease the development of B2B project-bidding applications. |br| |br|
OutSourcer is composed of a "Browsable API" and an "Admin Interface". |br| |br|
IT professionals who start software companies often find it quite difficult to get contracts for their firm (being a lot more difficult than applying to a personal job based on past professional experience). |br| |br|
Applications built using OutSourcer can enable software-companies of all sizes to outsource projects to other companies. Also, such applications can help small-company owners to apply to projects for their company just like they would apply to a job.

How it works?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Users** can create **Companies**
* **Companies** can publish **Projects**
* **Companies** can bid on other companiesâ€™ **Projects**
* **Projects** fall into **Categories**
* **Companies** can add **Comments** about other companies on a **Project**, if the project belongs to the company that is adding the comment.
* **Companies** can add **Recommendations** for other companies.

How will it evolve?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As it is the first version, we are planning on developing a lot of features in the future, as well as improving some behaviours. |br|
While the application is functional at this moment, we are expecting feedback and improvement ideas from people who use this app.

Is it free?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, you can use OutSourcer API absolutely free of charge.

Is it open-source?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, OutSourcer is open-source and it is distributed under BSD License.
