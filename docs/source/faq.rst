How will this improve?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As it is the first version, we are planning on developing a lot of features in the future, as well as improving some behaviours. |br|
While the application is functional at this moment, we are expecting feedback and improvement ideas from people who use this app. |br|
For the next release, we'll be completing some features like: |br|

- search |br|
- date-time filtering |br|
- results ordering |br|

which are now either missing or buggy.

I need to change code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If your project needs something different than the default functionality (and it almost surely will), feel free to adapt the code to fit your needs. |br|
