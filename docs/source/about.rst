About
======================================

What's this about?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OutSourcer is a self-managed, minimalist REST API which aims to ease the development of B2B project-bidding applications. |br| |br|
IT professionals who start software companies often find it quite difficult to get contracts for their firm (being a lot more difficult than applying to a personal job based on past professional experience). |br| |br|
Applications built using OutSourcer can enable software-companies of all sizes to outsource projects to other companies. Also, such applications can help small-company owners to apply to projects for their company just like they would apply to a job.

How it works?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Users** can create **Companies**
* **Companies** can publish **Projects**
* **Companies** can bid on other companiesâ€™ **Projects**
* **Projects** fall into **Categories**
* **Companies** can add **Comments** about other companies on a **Project**, if the project belongs to the company that is adding the comment.
* **Companies** can add **Recommendations** for other companies.


Is it free?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, anyone can use OutSourcer API absolutely free of charge.

Can I change it?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, OutSourcer is open-source and it is distributed under GPL Licence.
